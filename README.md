<h1> libft : My own custom libc...</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p> In this project, we had to make our own version of the libc with some custom fonctions.<br>
It wasn't easy since we had to make our functions behave the same like in the real libc functions.<br>
We also had a bonus part about linked lists. It was a fun project in which allowed me to learn new things about the C language. </p>

<h2>Compilation</h2>
<p>To compile the main part : <br><code>make</code><br>
To compile the bonus part (linked lists) : <br><code>make bonus</code><br>
to clean everything : <br><code>make fclean</code><br></p>

<h2>Using the lib</h2>
<p>After compilation, "libft.a" will be generated. You will be able to use all these fonctions in your C program.<br>
To import libft in your C program :<br>
<code>#include "libft.h"</code><br>
When compiling your C program, you must compile it with the libft file :<br>
<code>gcc *.c libft.a</code></p>
